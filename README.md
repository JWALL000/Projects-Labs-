## Project Overview
In this project, I used browser forensic techniques to identify a malicious extension within the infected computer's web browser.

## Steps:

## Step 3:
Next, I identified the number of Google Chrome profiles present in the browser, determined the current theme being used, and found the extension ID of the malicious extension, among other details.

## Step 4:
By examining the browser directories, I located the malicious extension, which was written in a .JSON file. This allowed me to uncover more details about the cryptomining tool used by the threat actor(s), including the hash rate calculated by the extension.
